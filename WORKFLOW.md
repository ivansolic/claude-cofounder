# WORKFLOW.md, Daily Operating Manual

How you work with Claude from idea to shipped feature.
Keep this open until the rhythm becomes muscle memory (~2-3 weeks).

> New to coding, or a concept here doesn't make sense? Read
> **`BEGINNERS-GUIDE.md`** first, it explains the ideas behind these commands
> (the two hats, the two modes, what a branch is, who triggers what) in plain
> language. This file is the *what to type*; that file is the *why*.

The workflow (the phases, the discipline, the rhythm) is yours and stays fixed.
The PM thinking inside Phase 1 is now powered entirely by the **pm-skills**
plugins, you don't use any custom PM commands or subagents for that work.

---

## Returning to Work (day 2 and beyond)

Your setup is installed once and stays, global `CLAUDE.md`, templates,
`init-project.sh`, and the pm-skills plugins are all permanent. You do NOT
reinstall any of that to start working again. You just open a project.

### Start a brand-new project
```bash
cd ~/Desktop                 # or wherever you keep projects
init-project.sh my-project   # scaffolds the full structure
cd my-project
gh repo create my-project --private --source=. --remote=origin --push
claude
```
Then, **first thing inside Claude**, configure the project for your stack:
```
/setup-project
```
Claude interviews you (stack, commands, conventions) and fills in `CLAUDE.md`, 
or you start from a preset in `~/.claude-templates/presets/`. Once per project.
Then begin Phase 1 (brainstorm → PRD → critique → stories) below.

### Come back to an existing project
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/my-project
claude --continue     # resumes your last session in this folder
# or: claude --resume   (pick from a list of past sessions)
# or: claude            (fresh session)
```
`.claude/tasks/todo.md` carries the active task state across sessions, so even a
fresh `claude` picks up where you left off.

### You do NOT need to redo
- ❌ Copy CLAUDE.md / templates
- ❌ Re-run `/plugin install` (pm-skills stay installed)
- ❌ Touch `~/.bash_profile`

### If commands seem missing in a session
```
/plugin list pm-skills    # should show your pm-* plugins, enabled
/reload-plugins           # if they show but don't respond
```

For first-time machine setup (or troubleshooting an install), see `INSTALL.md`.

```

**You drive every step manually.** Claude does NOT move to the next step on its
own, you decide when an output is good enough and when you advance. Each
`/skill` and each subagent is invoked explicitly by you. The only place Claude
loops on its own is implementation (Phase 2.2), and even that starts when you
say go.

One Claude session carries through all phases. VS Code sits beside the terminal
as your editor, it's a window, not a destination.

---

## IMPORTING EXTERNAL CONTENT (before Phase 1)

Already have a PRD, research, feature requests, or notes from elsewhere?
Don't start from zero, bring it in and continue from where you are.

### An external PRD or document

**Option A, paste it directly:**
> "Here is my existing PRD: [paste text]. Evaluate it and tell me what's missing."

**Option B, the file is already local:**
> "Read docs/prds/PRD-001-name.md and evaluate it."

**Option C, Notion / Google Docs / any tool:**
Copy the content → paste into Claude. There's no direct integration, copy/paste
is enough.

After importing, continue normally, usually jump to step **1.3 (critique)** or
**1.4 (user stories)**, skipping the steps you already did outside.

### External feature requests or user feedback

```
/pm-product-discovery:analyze-feature-requests
```
Paste the list, Claude triages, groups, and prioritizes them.

### External interview notes or research

```
/pm-product-discovery:summarize-interview
```
or
```
/pm-market-research:sentiment-analysis
```

---

## PHASE 1: PM, From Idea to Stories

All PM content here is produced by pm-skills. You keep the `docs/` folder
structure as the home for the output, when a skill produces a PRD or stories,
save them into `docs/prds/PRD-NNN-<slug>.md` and `docs/stories/USR-NNN-<slug>.md`
so the rest of the workflow (handoff, branching, reviews) still lines up.

### 1.1 Brainstorm

Start Claude in your project, plan mode ON (`Shift+Tab` twice).

```
/pm-product-discovery:brainstorm-ideas-new
```

For an existing product (adding a feature to something that ships already):
```
/pm-product-discovery:brainstorm-ideas-existing
```

The skill diverges to multiple distinct options before converging. Push back,
combine options, iterate until the idea has shape.

### 1.2 Write the PRD

When the idea has shape:

```
/pm-execution:create-prd
```

Walk through, in this order:
1. **The problem**, who hurts, how much, why now
2. **The outcome**, measurable success criteria
3. **Hypotheses**, what you're assuming and how you'd know you're wrong

⚠️ Don't fill in solutions before the problem is solid. If you catch yourself
jumping to features, that's the signal to slow down.

Save the result into `docs/prds/PRD-NNN-<slug>.md` (next free number, lowercase
hyphenated slug) so the folder convention stays intact.

### 1.3 Critique it

```
/pm-execution:strategy-red-team
```

Attacks the assumptions, hunts for holes in the logic, challenges the scope.

Then:
```
/pm-execution:pre-mortem
```

"It's 6 months later and this failed, why?" Top 3 failure modes ranked by
likelihood, with the leading signal you'd see for each.

**Security pre-mortem (required for sensitive features).** If the feature
touches authentication, personal data (PII), payments, file uploads, or anything
users would consider private, extend the pre-mortem with a security lens:

> "It's 6 months later and we had a breach or data leak through this feature.
> What was the hole? Where does this data live, who can reach it, and what's the
> worst path in? List the top 3 attack/leak scenarios and what the design must
> include to close them."

Capture the answers in the PRD (they become requirements and acceptance
criteria, not afterthoughts). This is where architecture-level security is
decided, code review later can't fix a design that stores or exposes the wrong
thing.

Revise the PRD based on the findings. Re-run if the changes were large.

### 1.4 Break into user stories

```
/pm-execution:user-stories
```

> "Order them by dependency, what must be built first. Save them into
> docs/stories/ as USR-NNN-<slug>.md."

Review what comes out. Good stories are:
- **Small**, one story = 0.5 to 2 days of work. Bigger → split it.
- **Independent** where possible, minimal blocking between stories
- **Testable**, acceptance criteria you can verify objectively

#### What a good story looks like

```markdown
## Story
As a registered user
I want to reset my password via email
So that I can regain access without contacting support

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] "Forgot password" link on login page sends reset email within 30s
- [ ] Reset link expires after 1 hour
- [ ] Used reset link cannot be reused
- [ ] Password must meet strength requirements (shown inline)
- [ ] User is logged in automatically after successful reset
```

Notice: every criterion is **observable and binary**, it either works or it
doesn't. "User-friendly flow" is NOT an acceptance criterion. "Error message
appears within the form, not as an alert" IS.

**For UI stories**, fold the design expectations into the same acceptance
criteria, the **user flow**, the **screens** touched, and **which states** apply
(loading / empty / error / no-results, plus focus/disabled where relevant). Keep
them behavioral and token-independent ("shows an empty state with an invite
action"), not visual ("uses blue"), the look comes from tokens at build time.
These ride in the normal AC list; you don't tag them as "design" vs "functional."

### 1.5 Commit the PM work

```
/commit-push
```

PM artifacts are code. They get committed like code (the command will put you
on a `docs/` branch if you're on main).

### Bonus PM skills (when the situation calls for it)

| Situation | Skill |
|---|---|
| Understand your users | `/pm-market-research:user-personas` |
| Segment the market | `/pm-market-research:market-segments` |
| Competitor analysis | `/pm-market-research:competitor-analysis` |
| Prioritize features | `/pm-product-discovery:prioritize-features` |
| Metrics / north star | `/pm-product-discovery:metrics-dashboard` |
| Value proposition | `/pm-product-strategy:value-proposition` |
| Product strategy / vision | `/pm-product-strategy:product-strategy` |
| OKRs | `/pm-execution:brainstorm-okrs` |
| Sprint plan | `/pm-execution:sprint-plan` |
| GTM / launch | `/pm-go-to-market:gtm-strategy` |
| Release notes | `/pm-execution:release-notes` |
| Retrospective | `/pm-execution:retro` |

Browse the full list with `/`, every pm-skills plugin namespaces its commands
(e.g. `pm-execution:`, `pm-market-research:`).

## When to Use Stories vs. Skip to todo.md

User stories are an **optional spec layer**, not a default. Decide with one
question:

> **"Is this more than ~1-2 days of work, OR does it split into independent
> pieces?"**
> Yes → use stories. No → skip them.

**Key point: `todo.md` is used in BOTH cases.** It's the execution layer and it
never goes away, it always holds the implementation plan for whatever you're
building right now. A story is just an optional spec *above* todo.md, never a
replacement for it.

- **With stories:** PRD → stories → `/dev-handoff` (per story) seeds the plan
  into `todo.md` → build
- **Without stories:** PRD → plan mode drafts the plan straight into `todo.md`
  → build

### The three tracks

| Scenario | Path |
|---|---|
| **New product / concept from scratch** (greenfield) | Brainstorm → (strategy/vision) → **PRD scoped to a thin MVP slice** → critique → **stories, ordered by dependency** → build story-by-story |
| **Incremental feature** on an existing product | PRD (light) → **todo.md** → build (skip stories) |
| **Trivial fix** | **todo.md** only, fast lane (skip PRD + stories) |

### Greenfield: why stories matter most here

Building from scratch is the scenario where stories help **most**, not least, a
new product is one vision that splits into many independent pieces (data model,
auth, core flow, settings, polish…). Stories keep that sprawling build into
small, separately reviewable steps.

The trap to avoid: writing one massive PRD for the *entire* product, then
generating 40 stories at once. Instead, scope the PRD to a **thin vertical slice
(the MVP)** and let stories sequence that slice:

```
/pm-product-discovery:brainstorm-ideas-new      → shape the concept
/pm-product-strategy:product-vision (optional)   → the north star
/pm-execution:create-prd                          → PRD for the MVP slice ONLY
/pm-execution:strategy-red-team + :pre-mortem    → pull it apart
/pm-execution:user-stories                        → decompose the slice,
                                                     order by dependency
   USR-001 data model  →  USR-002 auth  →  USR-003 core flow  → ...
/dev-handoff (per story) → build → review → PR → merge → next story
```

Each merged PR is one visible step toward the MVP.

### Fast lane (trivial changes)

For a typo, a copy tweak, a one-line fix, skip the PRD and stories entirely:

```
git checkout -b fix/<short-description>
# make the change → "Invoke code-reviewer" (still worth it) → /commit-push
gh pr create --fill → merge
```

The one rule that always holds, in every track: **never batch multiple stories
into one branch.** One story = one branch = one PR.

---

## PHASE TRANSITION

### Set up the design system (once, before building UI)

If this project has UI and you haven't done it yet, run, **after** the PM phase
(so it's informed by the PRD/personas/strategy), **before** building UI:

```
/setup-design
```

It ingests your existing tokens (or a Figma export), or proposes a starter from
your product context, then wires token compilation to your stack. One-time per
project. (Skip for API-only/backend projects.) Tokens become the styling source
of truth; the `ux-design` skill applies them when you build.

### /dev-handoff

When stories are ready and you're switching to building:

```
/dev-handoff
```

> ⚠️ **Run `/dev-handoff` in normal mode, not plan mode.** It creates the branch
> and writes `todo.md`, actions that plan mode (read-only) would block. Enter
> plan mode (`Shift+Tab` twice) only *after* it finishes, for step 2.1. Order:
> **dev-handoff (do) → plan mode (think) → exit plan mode (build).**

This will:
1. Ask which spec you're implementing
2. Verify the spec is actually ready (problem, outcome, scope all filled)
3. Write a handoff summary into `.claude/tasks/todo.md` (so context survives
   even if you start a fresh session later)
4. Create the feature branch from up-to-date main
5. Open VS Code (as editor, your Claude session stays in this terminal)

---

## PHASE 2: DEVELOPMENT, One Story at a Time

### The iron rule
**One story = one branch = one PR.** Never batch multiple stories into one
branch. Small changes are reviewable; big ones hide bugs.

### 2.1 Start the story

Plan mode ON (`Shift+Tab` twice), then:

> "Implement story docs/stories/USR-003-password-reset.md.
> Read it fully, then draft the implementation plan in todo.md."

Claude reads the story, drafts a step-by-step plan with checkable items.
**You review the plan before any code is written.** Ask questions. Change steps.
Only approve when you understand what's about to happen.

### 2.2 Implementation

Switch out of plan mode (Shift+Tab) and let Claude work.

With `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_VERIFY=1` set, Claude automatically loops:
generate → lint → typecheck → test → self-correct → repeat until green.

**TDD-lite (automatic):** for logic with clear rules, backend, API, services,
validation, calculations, bug fixes, the `test-driven-development` skill engages
on its own: it turns each acceptance criterion into a failing test *before* the
implementation, then drives it green (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR). You don't invoke
it. For UI/component layout, visual exploration, prototypes, and trivial fixes it
stays out of the way (tests come after, if at all). If you ever want to force it
on or off for a given piece, just say so.

Your job during this: read what Claude is doing. You don't need to understand
every line, but watch for:
- Files being touched that the plan didn't mention → ask why
- The same error appearing twice → say "Stop. Re-enter plan mode and
  reinvestigate the root cause."
- Claude saying "done" without showing verification → ask "Prove it works."

### 2.3 Verify against acceptance criteria

When Claude says the story is implemented:

> "Walk through every acceptance criterion in the story one by one.
> For each: demonstrate it passes, or mark it as failing."

This is the moment the story format pays off, the criteria ARE the test plan.
Anything failing → back to implementation.

### 2.4 Code review

> "Invoke the code-reviewer subagent on these changes."

The reviewer returns a verdict (APPROVE / APPROVE WITH COMMENTS / REQUEST
CHANGES) with findings sorted Critical → Important → Nitpicks.

**Rule: fix all Critical and Important findings. Nitpicks are your call.**
Skipping the review or ignoring Criticals = removing your own safety net.

**For UI changes, also run the design review:**

> "Invoke the design-reviewer subagent on these changes."

`code-reviewer` covers logic/security; `design-reviewer` covers UI only, 
usability heuristics, all states (loading/empty/error + hover/focus/disabled),
accessibility, and design-token adherence (no hardcoded styles). Same Critical →
Important → Nitpicks rule. Skip it for backend-only changes.

### 2.4b Security review (for sensitive changes)

If the change touches **auth, user input handling, file uploads, payments, or
data access**, run the built-in security review before committing:

```
/security-review
```

This is a dedicated vulnerability hunt over the pending changes, deeper on
security than code-reviewer's general sweep (injection, authz gaps, secrets
exposure, unsafe handling). Treat its findings like code-review Criticals: fix
before commit.

Also, if this story **added or updated dependencies**: run `pnpm audit` (or your
package manager's equivalent) and resolve criticals/highs before shipping.

For ordinary changes (UI layout, copy, internal refactors with no input/data
surface), skipping this step is fine, code-reviewer still covers the basics.

### 2.5 Commit and push

```
/commit-push
```

The command checks you're on a branch, scans for secrets, runs lint+typecheck,
proposes a conventional commit message, and pushes.

### 2.6 Architecture decisions along the way

If during implementation you hit a structural question ("should this be a
separate module?", "REST or WebSocket here?"):

> "Invoke the architecture-reviewer subagent on this question: [describe]"

If the decision is significant, capture it:

> "Create an ADR for this decision using docs/templates/ADR-TEMPLATE.md"

Future-you (and future teammates) will thank you for the WHY being written down.

---

## PHASE 3: CLOSE, Per Story

### Definition of Done (every story)

pm-skills stories carry their own acceptance criteria but not a DoD checklist, 
this is yours, the same gate for every story before it's "done":

- [ ] Code merged to main via PR
- [ ] Tests added (unit + e2e where relevant)
- [ ] Documentation updated (if user-facing or API change)
- [ ] No new linter or typecheck errors
- [ ] Acceptance criteria all met
- [ ] Reviewed by the `code-reviewer` subagent (or a human reviewer)
- [ ] `/security-review` passed, required if the change touches auth, input,
      uploads, payments, or data access
- [ ] No new `pnpm audit` criticals/highs, required if dependencies changed
- [ ] No PII or secrets in logs, commits, or error messages introduced by this story

### 3.1 Pull Request

After the final push, open the PR on GitHub:
```bash
gh pr create --fill
```
Or use the link GitHub prints after push.

Even solo, read your own PR diff on GitHub once. You'll catch things.
Then merge (squash-merge keeps main history clean).

### 3.2 Cleanup

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git branch -d feature/<name>
git push origin --delete feature/<name>
```

### 3.3 Close the loop in the project

> "Mark story USR-003 as Done. Add the Review section to todo.md:
> what shipped, what was harder than expected, any follow-ups."

### 3.4 Lessons (only if corrections happened)

If you corrected Claude during the story:

> "Update lessons.md with what went wrong. If the rule applies beyond this
> task, propose an update to CLAUDE.md too."

Review the proposed rule before it's written. This is how Claude gets
measurably better on YOUR project over time.

### 3.5 End-of-session retro (a 2-minute habit)

Before you close a working session, run:

```
/retro
```

It looks back over the session, proposes the lessons worth keeping, and routes
each (with your approval), project-specific → `.claude/tasks/lessons.md`; a rule
that applies to all your work → a proposed global CLAUDE.md update.

> ⚠️ `/retro` is something **you invoke** when wrapping up, Claude can't detect
> that you're ending a session, so nothing fires it automatically.

This turns the learning files from "filled only on correction" into "reviewed
every session." Over weeks, `lessons.md` and your CLAUDE.md files quietly become
a record of how *you* like to work, and Claude stops repeating the same misses.

### Then: next story. Back to 2.1.

---

## Working With Claude, Rules of Thumb

### Trust but verify
Claude is a very talented junior who always sounds confident. Your job is the
senior's job: "How do you know it works?" / "Did you actually run it?"

### Signals Claude made a mistake
1. Says "done" without running anything → demand proof
2. Uses a function you can't find defined anywhere → likely hallucinated
3. Code works but does MORE than you asked → scope creep, ask why
4. Same fix attempted twice with small variations → it's guessing; force re-plan
5. You read the code and feel confused → not your fault; ask Claude to explain
   (it often finds its own bug while explaining)

### When things go sideways
- **STOP early.** The global CLAUDE.md tells Claude to re-plan when stuck,
  but you can force it: "Stop. Enter plan mode. Reinvestigate from scratch."
- **Don't let it push through.** Three failed attempts at the same problem
  means the approach is wrong, not the execution.

### Session management
- One session per day per project is normal
- If context gets long and Claude gets "forgetful": `/compact` (compresses
  history) or start fresh, `todo.md` carries the active task state across
  sessions, that's exactly why it exists
- Resume a previous session anytime: `claude --continue` (last session) or
  `claude --resume` (pick from list)
- Works identically in native terminal and VS Code terminal, they have the
  same rights; permissions belong to your user account, not the terminal window

### Skill & subagent invocation (your current level)
Invoke explicitly, every time:
- PM thinking (Phase 1) → the `pm-skills` commands above (`/pm-execution:*`,
  `/pm-product-discovery:*`, `/pm-market-research:*`, …)
- `code-reviewer` subagent → before every commit
- `architecture-reviewer` subagent → any decision touching multiple modules

After ~2 months, when you can tell when reviews get skipped, you can start
trusting auto-invocation.
