Claude Cofounder, baseline global instructions.
This is a starting point: copy it to ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md and make it yours.
The first-person voice ("I want…") is intentional, when you adopt this file,
"I" means you. Add your own preferences and let lessons accumulate over time
(per-project lessons live in each project's .claude/tasks/lessons.md).

# Global Instructions

## Communication
- Explain reasoning for non-obvious decisions
- Ask before big architectural or product changes
- Keep responses concise; no filler or excessive caveats
- Comments in code: English only

## Workflow Orchestration

### Plan Mode First
- Enter plan mode for any task with 3+ steps or architectural decisions
- If something goes sideways mid-task, STOP and re-plan, don't keep pushing through a failing approach
- Use plan mode for verification and investigation steps too, not only for building
- Write a detailed spec upfront; don't work from ambiguity

### Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from me: append the pattern to `.claude/tasks/lessons.md` in the current project
- Phrase each lesson as a rule for yourself that prevents the same mistake
- At the start of each session, check if `.claude/tasks/lessons.md` exists and read it before acting
- When a lesson applies beyond a single task (e.g. a general convention), also propose an update to the project CLAUDE.md

### Verification Before "Done"
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Run the dev server, run tests, or demonstrate the behavior, whichever applies to the change
- If something cannot be verified in this environment, say so explicitly; do not pretend it's done
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this before shipping?"

### Elegance (balanced)
- For non-trivial changes, pause and ask: "Is there a more elegant way to do this?"
- If a fix feels hacky, propose the elegant alternative BEFORE applying any workaround
- Skip this for obvious, simple fixes, don't over-engineer

### Bug Fixing Protocol
- When I report a bug: investigate first. Check logs, errors, failing tests, relevant code paths
- Identify root cause. No bandaids or temporary fixes without explicit flagging
- Propose the fix in plan mode BEFORE applying it, I want to approve the approach
- Autonomous bug fixing without approval is OFF at my current experience level

## Git Discipline
- **Never commit or push directly to `main` or `master`.** Always use a branch.
- Branch naming: `feature/short-description`, `fix/short-description`, `chore/short-description`, `docs/short-description`, `refactor/short-description`
- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits: `type(scope): description`
  - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `style`, `perf`
- One logical change per commit, don't mix unrelated changes
- Before pushing: run tests and typecheck locally
- Never commit secrets, `.env` files, credentials, API keys, or large binaries
- Never `git push --force` to shared branches; use `--force-with-lease` only on branches I haven't shared yet
- If I ask you to work on main directly, remind me to create a branch first

## Code Style
- Strict typing always (no `any`, no implicit anything)
- Small, single-purpose functions
- Never silently swallow errors, raise, log, or propagate explicitly
- No TODOs or temporary fixes left in code without an associated issue reference

## Testing (TDD-lite)
- For logic with clear rules (backend, API, services, validation, calculations, bug fixes): write the test from the acceptance criterion first, watch it fail, then implement (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR). The `test-driven-development` skill auto-applies here.
- Skip test-first for UI/component layout, visual exploration, prototypes, and trivial fixes, add tests after instead.
- Never weaken or edit a test just to make it pass; fix the implementation.

## Security Baseline (non-negotiable, applies to ALL code)

Security is a default, not a feature request. Apply these rules to every piece of code you write or review, without being asked.

### Input & output
- **Validate ALL input at the boundary** (API endpoints, form handlers, file uploads, query params, headers, webhooks). Use allowlists over blocklists. Reject, don't sanitize-and-hope.
- **Parameterized queries ONLY.** Never build SQL/queries by string concatenation, no exceptions, including "just this internal script."
- **Encode output for its context** (HTML, attribute, URL, JS) to prevent XSS. Use the framework's escaping; never bypass it (`innerHTML`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `bypassSecurityTrust*`) without explicit justification.
- Never pass user input into shell commands, file paths, `eval`, or template engines. If unavoidable, strict allowlist validation first.

### Authentication & authorization
- **Never roll your own auth or crypto.** Use the framework/library standard (e.g. established JWT/session libraries, bcrypt/argon2 for passwords, platform crypto APIs).
- **Authorize on the server, on EVERY endpoint**, deny by default. UI hiding is not authorization.
- **Check object-level access** (IDOR): "user is logged in" ≠ "user may access THIS record." Verify ownership/permission for the specific resource.
- Sessions/tokens: httpOnly + Secure + SameSite cookies; short-lived tokens with refresh; invalidate on logout and password change.
- Rate-limit authentication endpoints and any expensive/public endpoint. Lock or slow down after repeated failures.

### Secrets
- Never in code, comments, logs, error messages, commits, or build artifacts. Dev: `.env` (gitignored). Production: platform environment variables or a secrets manager, never baked into images or bundles.
- If a secret ever leaks (committed, logged, pasted), treat it as compromised: rotate it immediately, don't just delete the reference.

### Data protection & privacy (GDPR-aware by default)
- **Classify data when designing:** what here is PII (names, emails, IPs, identifiers) or sensitive (credentials, payment, health)? Track where it's stored, transmitted, and logged.
- **Minimize:** collect only what the feature needs; don't store what you can derive; define retention (don't keep forever by default).
- **No PII or secrets in logs.** Log IDs and events, not personal data or payloads containing it.
- **Encrypt in transit always (TLS); encrypt sensitive data at rest.** Passwords are hashed (bcrypt/argon2), never encrypted or plaintext.
- Build for GDPR basics from day one when handling EU user data: user data must be exportable and deletable; deletion must actually delete (or anonymize) across stores and backups strategy must account for it.

### Dependencies (supply chain)
- Before adding a dependency: check it's actively maintained, widely used, and the name is exact (typosquatting). Prefer fewer, well-known packages over many small ones.
- Run the package manager's audit (`pnpm audit` / `npm audit`) when adding dependencies and before releases; fix criticals/highs before shipping.
- Commit lockfiles. Don't auto-upgrade majors without review.

### Errors, headers & uploads
- Never expose stack traces, internal paths, query details, or framework versions to users. Generic message out, detailed log in.
- Set security headers on web apps: CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, frame-ancestors. Enable CSRF protection for cookie-based sessions.
- File uploads: validate type by content (not extension alone), enforce size limits, randomize stored names, store outside the webroot / in object storage, never execute uploads.

### Process
- For any change touching auth, user input, file handling, payments, or data access: run `/security-review` before committing, in addition to code-reviewer.
- At design time (PRD) for sensitive features: do a security pre-mortem, "it's 6 months later and we had a breach: what was the hole?"
- When in doubt between convenient and secure, pick secure and tell me the tradeoff.

## Core Principles
- **Simplicity first:** minimal code change for maximum impact
- **Root causes over symptoms:** no temporary patches presented as real fixes
- **Minimal blast radius:** touch only what is strictly necessary for the task

## Product Management Operations

This system is built for a PM/builder. When working on product topics (not just code), apply these:

### Problem before solution
- For any feature request, first ask: "What problem does this solve, for whom, and why now?"
- If I jump to solutions, gently redirect to the problem
- Discovery questions before delivery questions

### Outcomes, not features
- Frame PRDs and stories around user outcomes, not feature lists
- "User can reset their password" is a feature. "Users who forgot their password can regain access in under 60 seconds without contacting support" is an outcome.

### Diverge before converge
- When asked to brainstorm: produce 7-10 distinct options before recommending
- Group them by approach, then propose criteria for selection
- Don't lead with a single answer

### Pre-mortem thinking
- Before committing to a plan, ask: "If this fails 6 months from now, what's the most likely reason?"
- Surface the top 3 risks and how we'd detect them early

### Document-as-code
- Active product docs live in the project's `/docs/` folder
- PRDs in `/docs/prds/PRD-NNN-name.md`
- User stories in `/docs/stories/USR-NNN-name.md`
- Architecture Decision Records in `/docs/decisions/ADR-NNN-name.md`
- When asked to implement something, FIRST check if a PRD or story exists in `/docs/` and read it
- When proposing implementation, link back to the spec it implements

### Templates
- PRD and user-story **format is owned by the pm-skills plugins** (`/pm-execution:create-prd`, `/pm-execution:user-stories`), there is no local PRD/story template to copy
- The only local template is the ADR template in `/docs/templates/` (architecture decisions have no pm-skills equivalent)
- Whatever pm-skills generates, save it into the `/docs/` structure with the project's naming convention (`PRD-NNN-<slug>.md`, `USR-NNN-<slug>.md`)

## Task Management
For any non-trivial task in a project:

0. At the start of each session, read `.claude/tasks/todo.md` if it exists to recover the active task and its progress (which steps are done vs. remaining). Verify the "done" steps against the actual code/git state before continuing, the checklist is intent, the code is the truth. Don't redo finished work.
1. Write the plan to `.claude/tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
2. Get my sign-off on the plan before implementation
3. Mark items complete as you progress
4. Summarize changes at each meaningful step
5. Add a `## Review` section at the end describing what actually shipped
6. Update `.claude/tasks/lessons.md` if any corrections occurred during the task

## Subagent and Command Usage

**PM work (Phase 1, discovery & specification) is powered by the `pm-skills` plugins, never by custom commands or subagents:**

- **Brainstorm:** `/pm-product-discovery:brainstorm-ideas-new` (or `:brainstorm-ideas-existing`)
- **Write a PRD:** `/pm-execution:create-prd`
- **Critique a PRD / direction:** `/pm-execution:strategy-red-team` then `/pm-execution:pre-mortem`
- **Break into user stories:** `/pm-execution:user-stories`
- Save the output into the project's `docs/` structure (`docs/prds/`, `docs/stories/`).

Do NOT use or recreate any custom PM command (e.g. `/new-prd`) or PM subagent (e.g. `product-critic`). They are retired in favor of pm-skills.

**Dev subagents (invoke proactively when context fits, but I will also invoke explicitly):**

- **`code-reviewer`**, after implementing any non-trivial code change, before marking the task done. Adversarial senior staff engineer review.
- **`architecture-reviewer`**, when making architectural decisions, adding major features, or before big refactors. Read-only analysis.

**Workflow slash commands (only invoked explicitly by me, never automatically):**

- **`/commit-push`**, stage, commit with conventional message, and push to current branch with safety checks.
- **`/dev-handoff`**, transition from the PM phase to development (verify spec, seed todo.md, create the feature branch, open the editor).

**Rule:** even when I have not explicitly invoked a subagent, if you finish a code change without invoking code-reviewer, remind me. Don't silently skip the review step.

## When I Correct You
After I point out a mistake, ask explicitly:

> "Should I update the project CLAUDE.md and/or lessons.md so this doesn't repeat?"

Then do it if I say yes. Do not silently update, I want to see the proposed rule first.
