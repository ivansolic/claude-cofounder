# Project: [FILL IN NAME]

_Last updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]_

> 🚀 **First time in this project?** Run `/setup-project` and Claude will
> interview you (stack, commands, conventions) and fill in the sections below.
> Or, if your stack matches one, start from a preset in `~/.claude-templates/presets/`.
> Until then, the `[...]` placeholders below are for you to replace.

## Purpose
[1-2 sentences describing what this project is, who it's for, and the outcome it produces.]

## Stack

_Replace the placeholders with your actual stack. Keep it specific, versions matter._

### Frontend
- **Framework:** [e.g. React 19 / Angular 22 / Vue 3 / Svelte, or "none / API-only"]
- **Language:** [e.g. TypeScript strict mode]
- **State / data:** [state library, data-fetching approach]
- **UI library:** [component/design system]
- **Testing:** [e.g. Vitest / Jest / Playwright]
- **Linting:** [e.g. ESLint + Prettier]

### Backend
- **Framework:** [e.g. NestJS / Express / FastAPI / Django / Go stdlib]
- **Language / runtime:** [e.g. TypeScript on Node 22 / Python 3.12 / Go 1.22]
- **ORM / data access:** [e.g. Prisma / Drizzle / SQLAlchemy / none]
- **Database:** [e.g. PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQLite / MongoDB]
- **Validation:** [e.g. zod / class-validator / pydantic]
- **Auth:** [e.g. JWT / OAuth / session, decide per project]
- **Testing:** [e.g. Jest + Supertest / pytest]
- **API style:** [e.g. REST + OpenAPI / GraphQL / gRPC]

### Shared
- **Package manager:** [e.g. pnpm / npm / uv / go mod]
- **Monorepo (if used):** [e.g. Nx / Turborepo / none]
- **Deployment:** [e.g. Vercel / Railway / Fly.io / internal]
- **Env management:** [e.g. `.env` files, never committed]

## Commands

_The exact commands Claude should run. The TDD skill and the auto-verify loop use
these, fill them in accurately._

- **dev:** [start the app, e.g. `pnpm dev`]
- **test:** [run unit tests, e.g. `pnpm test`]
- **test (backend):** [if separate, e.g. `pnpm test:api`]
- **test:e2e:** [integration/e2e tests, if any]
- **lint:** [e.g. `pnpm lint`]
- **typecheck:** [e.g. `pnpm typecheck` / `tsc --noEmit`]
- **build:** [e.g. `pnpm build`]
- **db (migrate / generate / studio):** [if applicable]

## Architecture
- **Pattern:** [Monolith / Modular monolith / Microservices / Serverless, chosen during `/setup-project`]
- **Why:** [one line on the trade-off you accepted]
- _Keep new work consistent with this. Revisit via the `architecture-reviewer`
  subagent + an ADR when there's a real reason to change._

## Design
- **UI library / design system:** [e.g. shadcn / MUI / Chakra / custom, set during `/setup-design`]
- **Design tokens:** `design/tokens.json` (source of truth) → compiled to [Tailwind theme / CSS variables / theme object]
- **Rule:** all styling references **semantic tokens**, never hardcode colors, spacing, font sizes, radii. Reuse existing components; don't reinvent.
- **Build command:** [e.g. `pnpm tokens:build`]
- UI work follows the `ux-design` skill (heuristics, states, accessibility) and is reviewed by the `design-reviewer` subagent.

## Project Structure

```
[Describe or paste your folder layout so Claude knows where things go.
 e.g. apps/web (frontend), apps/api (backend), libs/ (shared), docs/, .claude/]
```

## Conventions

_Your house rules. Be concrete, these shape every change Claude makes._

### Frontend
- [e.g. component model, state patterns, control-flow syntax, file organization]

### Backend
- [e.g. one feature = one module, DTO validation, services own logic, repo pattern]

### Database
- [e.g. migrations only, naming, type/collation specifics]

### Shared
- [e.g. shared types location, no type duplication across FE/BE, typed end-to-end]

## Security & Data

_The global Security Baseline (in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) applies to all code in
this project automatically, input validation, parameterized queries, authz on
every endpoint, no PII in logs, secrets hygiene, dependency audit. The section
below records what is **specific to this project**. `/setup-project` fills it in._

### Sensitive data inventory
- **Personal data (PII) handled:** [e.g. names, emails, IP addresses, or "none"]
- **Special/sensitive data:** [e.g. payment data, health data, or "none"]
- **Where it lives:** [DB tables/collections, third-party processors]
- **Retention:** [how long is each kept; what gets deleted/anonymized, when]

### Users & compliance
- **User base / region:** [e.g. EU users → GDPR applies]
- **Compliance requirements:** [GDPR / none known / industry-specific]
- **Data subject rights (if GDPR):** export and deletion must work end-to-end, 
  [where is delete implemented / TODO]

### Authentication & access
- **Auth model:** [none / email+password / OAuth provider / SSO]
- **Roles & permissions:** [e.g. user/admin, who may access what]
- **Session strategy:** [cookies (httpOnly+Secure+SameSite) / tokens + refresh]

### Project-specific security rules
- [e.g. "all uploads go to S3, never local disk", "admin routes require 2FA",
  "rate limit: 5 login attempts / 15 min", added as they're decided]

### Security checkpoints (process, always on)
- Changes touching auth, input handling, uploads, payments, or data access →
  run `/security-review` before committing (in addition to code-reviewer)
- New dependency → verify maintenance/name, then `pnpm audit` (or equivalent)
- Sensitive feature at PRD stage → include a security pre-mortem

## Git Workflow
**Hard rule, not a suggestion.**

- `main` is protected. Never commit or push directly to it.
- Every change lives on a branch:
  - `feature/<short-description>`, new functionality
  - `fix/<short-description>`, bug fixes
  - `chore/<short-description>`, maintenance, dependencies
  - `docs/<short-description>`, documentation only
  - `refactor/<short-description>`, code restructuring without behavior change
- Commit messages use Conventional Commits: `type(scope): description`
  - Examples: `feat(api): add user search endpoint`, `fix(web): handle empty list state`
- One logical change per commit
- Before pushing: lint and typecheck must pass
- Every merge to `main` goes through a Pull Request
- Never commit: `.env`, secrets, dependencies, build artifacts, large binaries
- After PR is merged, delete branch locally and remotely

## Product Documentation

Product specs live in `/docs/`:

- **`/docs/prds/`**, PRDs (one per major feature)
- **`/docs/stories/`**, user stories (smaller units of work)
- **`/docs/decisions/`**, Architecture Decision Records (capture WHY for non-obvious choices)
- **`/docs/research/`**, user research, interviews, market notes
- **`/docs/templates/`**, ADR template (PRD and story format come from the pm-skills plugins, not a local template)

PRDs and user stories are generated by the pm-skills plugins (`/pm-execution:create-prd`, `/pm-execution:user-stories`) and saved here as `PRD-NNN-<slug>.md` / `USR-NNN-<slug>.md`.

When implementing a feature, **first read the relevant PRD or story** before writing code. If no spec exists for non-trivial work, propose creating one before implementing.

## Don't
- [Project-specific anti-patterns. e.g. "Don't bypass strict typing without a comment", "Don't introduce a new dependency without checking with me", "Don't commit generated files"]

## Corrections
_Claude: append project-specific lessons here when I correct you._
